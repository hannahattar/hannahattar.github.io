      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Short-horizon equity return prediction is noisy, and models trained on pooled data can appear stable on average while behaving
        differently across market conditions. This project studies how predictive confidence and decision behavior vary across inferred
        market regimes and what that implies for deployment. Using daily SPY data, regimes are identified endogenously with a Gaussian
        Mixture Model (GMM) based on recent returns and realized volatility. A probabilistic logistic classifier is then evaluated
        out-of-sample by stratifying accuracy by confidence and regime. Finally, an illustrative strategy uses confidence filtering and
        regime-based deactivation to examine how selective deployment can alter drawdown and risk profiles, even when raw predictive
        performance is limited.

        The inferred regimes display clear temporal clustering, with the highest-volatility state concentrated around prolonged stress
        episodes. This persistence supports interpreting regimes as market conditions rather than transient noise.

      <p class="muted">
        Accuracy varies across regimes and does not increase monotonically with confidence. In the highest-volatility regime,
        high-confidence predictions exhibit substantial variability, indicating degraded reliability under turbulent conditions.

        The equity curve illustrates how confidence filtering and regime-based deactivation primarily affect drawdown depth and return
        volatility rather than raw predictive accuracy. Results are gross of transaction costs.

        Regimes occupy distinct regions of the ret5, vol20 feature space, implying that a single global decision boundary

          <li><strong>Regime dependence:</strong> reliability varies across inferred market states.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence filtering:</strong> thresholds are more defensible than probability ranking.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk control:</strong> regime-aware deployment mainly alters drawdown and volatility.</li>

      <h2>Calibration and Probability Compression</h2>
      <p>
        Predicted probabilities are concentrated near the unconditional mean, consistent with probability compression at the daily horizon.
        The out-of-sample Brier score of approximately 0.247 is close to an uninformative baseline, reinforcing conservative interpretation
        of probabilistic outputs.

      <h2>Notes on Interpretation</h2>
      <p>
        This project is intentionally diagnostic rather than predictive. The primary contribution is identifying regime-conditional
        structure in confidence reliability and demonstrating how deployment rules can respond to that heterogeneity.
