      <h1>About</h1>

      <p class="lede">
        I am a Master’s student in Financial Engineering at the University of Southern California with a strong interest in quantitative modeling at the intersection of probability, economics, and real-world financial systems. My work is driven by a desire to understand how abstract mathematical structures—such as stochastic processes and statistical models—translate into observable financial behavior in markets and real assets, and how these tools can be used to reason rigorously about uncertainty, dynamics, and risk.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        In my current graduate studies at USC, I have completed coursework in probability, stochastic processes, machine learning, and mathematical methods for financial engineering. I have also taken applied finance courses including corporate finance and mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which have deepened my interest in housing markets, structured products, and the interaction between quantitative models and institutional market design.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics, graduating with honors in three years, with a minor in English Literature. My academic focus was on econometrics and applied econometric analysis, including multiple advanced econometrics courses, one of which was at the graduate level. In parallel, I pursued graduate-level coursework in data science and machine learning, developing a strong foundation in empirical modeling and data-driven analysis.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        Outside of academics, I enjoy playing chess and studying strategic games that emphasize long-horizon reasoning, as well as creative writing and literature.
