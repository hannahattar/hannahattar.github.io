      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        I am a Master’s student in Financial Engineering at the University of Southern California with a strong interest in quantitative modeling at the intersection of probability, finance, and real economic systems. My work is driven by a desire to understand how abstract mathematical structures such as stochastic processes and statistical models translate into observable financial behavior in markets and real assets. I am particularly motivated by problems where uncertainty, dynamics, and human behavior interact, and I enjoy building models that are not only technically sound but also interpretable and grounded in economic intuition.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        My research interests center on stochastic processes, machine learning, and applied econometrics as tools for analyzing complex financial and economic systems. I am especially interested in Monte Carlo simulation, probabilistic modeling, and data-driven methods for understanding asset dynamics, market regimes, and risk. In parallel, I am drawn to housing and mortgage markets, including mortgage-backed securities and prepayment behavior, where structural modeling and empirical analysis play a critical role. More broadly, I am interested in probability theory as a unifying language for modeling uncertainty across financial markets and real-world economic phenomena.
